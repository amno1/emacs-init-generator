* About

Ramblings in Art and Craft of Emacs init file configuration and Elisp.

This tool combines org-mode structuring with few macros to help configure Emacs
and it's third party packages. It is self-contained and requires no additional
dependencies but Emacs itself. Tested with Emacs 27.1 and 28.0.50 on GNU/Linux
and Microsoft Windows 10.

I consider this as an prototype in alpha stage, and have some further ideas for
the tool itself and some more optimizations for the generated init file. I am
not sure when I will have time to finnish them. The tool is usable though and
it would be cool to get some thoughts and input on it. More details about the
tool can be found in [[http://www.nextpoint.se/?p=834][my blog post]].

* Changelog
<2020-12-23 ons>

A slight fix for the case when generator.org is placed in user-emacs-directory
(.emacs.d/). In [[https://github.com/amno1/.emacs.d][my personal setup]], I have generator.org in .emacs.d renamed to
init.org. The goal is to be able to just run M-x generate-init-files and be done
with it. Currently, M-x install-init-files still needs to be run after, in order
to delete quickstart files; otherwise Emacs will load those before it loads the
init file with baked-in autoloads which will perform double work and slightly
slow down the init time. I will move deletion of quickstart files to proper
place at some other time.

<2020-12-20 sÃ¶n>

Early-init tangling is now properly done completely in temporary file, not
messing with Early init section in the generator as I hacked it hastily some day
ago. In [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-12/msg01103.html][mail conversation on emacs-devel]], S. Monnier (writer of package
quickstart feature) confirmed that it is safe to byte compile
package-quickstart.el. It will be turned on by default in future versions of
Emacs, so I assume that it is safe to keep baking this file into init file by
default.

<2020-12-18 fre>

The tool can now bake `quickstart' file (package-quickstart.el) into init
file. In my own setup this makes for a drammatic difference in startup
time. However byte-compiling package-quickstart.el file might not work in all
setups, so this really has to be tested with your setup.

Baking of quickstart file is enabled by setting variable /init-file-bake-autloads/
to t.

If this option is on, the tool will remove /package-quickstart.el/ (and .elc if
it exists) from the .emacs.d directory.

If this option is nil, the quickstart will be on, and tool will generate new
package-quickstart.el and byte compile it. Both files will be installed in
user's Emacs directory (.emacs.d).

I have also implemented option to "unroll" key bindings in both with-hook and
eval-after-load macros. The option is on by default, but can be disabled by
setting /init-file-unroll-key-bindings/ to nil.

There is a new macro to add a package with :pseudo option for the convenience.

* Get Started

*BACKUP YOUR INIT FILE(S) BEFORE YOU USE THIS TOOL*

Clone this repo, or download manually generator.org file. Open the
downloaded file in Emacs and let it evaluate the startup section (the generator itself).
Edit setup to suit your needs and taste. Once done, M-x generate-init-files and then
M-x install-files to install generated files to your .emacs.d directory.

OBS: do not run C-c C-v t (org-babel-tangle). This tool generates the code by
other means. You can read more in [[http://www.nextpoint.se/wp-admin/post.php?post=834&action=edit][my blog post]] about deatils and reasons behind.

* Details about the tool

** Features:

- self-contained
- optimize quickstart file (precompute and prepend package load paths)
- merge quickstart file with init file 
- byte compile init files
- generate unrolled key binding definitions
- merge some generated lambdas where applicable
- out-of-session configuration and package administration
- very simplistic configuration options (only two macros)
- minimal overhead at runtime
- some of well-known hacks applied by default
  
** Downsides

- can't be used with well-known tools like straight and use-package (it can, but
  there is no point)
- requires deeper knowledge of how Emacs works (mode hooks and eval-after-load)
- not well tested, buggy and probably erronoeus at the moment
- does lots of assumptions; not very general, nor flexible, nor robust

** Description

The tool is not ment to be used as a library or to be used /on a file/. It is a
self-contained tool; i.e. it contains both a setup and code needed to generate
init files. Starting a new setup means to simply copy generator.org, open that
file and modify the relevant sections (mostly early init and packages section).

** Sections in the tool

Each section is contained in it's own header.

About     - contains help, license and references that influenced the tool.

Generator - contains code for the tool itself, and is the only section
            that needs to be evaluated when the file is opened in Emacs.
            
Prolog    - early init and part of init generated before main configuration starts

Packages  - contains main configuration part, one subheading for each package

Epilog    - some code generated after the main configuration ends.


Generally, only early init part and package sections are of interest when
editing a configuration.

** Early Init

Early-init.el should be used mainly to setup some options for graphical
components before graphical setup is initialized since it is wasteful to
initialize them just to overwrite and redraw them later in the initialization
process.

Subsection for configuring early-init.el is found in Prolog, named /Early
init/. Any code put there is simply copy-pasted verbatim into early-init.el. It
is not evaluated.

** Init

Init.el is where the main configuration is. In order to abstract away and save
some typing, configuration is split in three parts: init, a subheading of Prolog,
Packages and Epilog. Of those really Packages is what is interesting. Prolog and
Epilog contain some boiler-plate code that implements some usual optimisations
as found in [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/faq.org#how-does-doom-start-up-so-quickly][H. Lissner's excellent Doom Faq]] or [[https://github.com/nilcons/emacs-use-package-fast][elsewhere]]. Code in Prolog and
Epilog is written to the file verbatim, as if copy-pasted, and hopefully does
not need to be touched.

** Packages

The most action happends in this section. It is here where both built-in and
external packages are configured. The tool provides currently only two simple
macros to configure the code:

/with-package/ macro is used to generate code that will run in /eval-after-load/.

/with-hook/ is used to add the code that will be run in some Emacs hook. Suffix
-hook often found in Emacs such as in /after-init-hook/ or /dired-mode-hook/ and
similar can be omitted. 

All code in Packages section is evaluated, so those macros are actually self-inserting.

This is a deferred setup, so most generally we wish to run code in either eval-after-load
or in some mode hook. Thus /with-package/ is just a shorthand for /with-eval-after-load/
macro, to make it little bit less verbose to type and less noisy to look at, albeit I
might add some more optimizations to produced setup in this macro soon.

One reason for using self-inserting code is that it is easier to write the generator that
way, at least what I think currently. Those macros are not written to the init file either,
instead they are expanded and the final result is added to the file, in quest for less
overhead.

/with-key-map/ is a small macro for binding keys. I find it a bit verbose to
type all that code to bind keys, so I have implemented a small macro, again in
style of use-package, or rather bind-key, another Wiegley's package.

Here I was playing with some optimisation, and unrolled the loop that results
from the expansion of this macro, i.e. I generated all those define key
statments in place of the loop. It can be tested by simply replacing following
function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun emit-sexp-to-init-file (sexp)
     (append-to-init-file (prin1-to-string sexp)))
      ;; (if (equal (symbol-name (car sexp)) "with-key-map")
      ;;     (emit-keymap (cdr sexp))
      ;;   (append-to-init-file (prin1-to-string sexp))))
#+end_src

with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun emit-sexp-to-init-file (sexp)
     ;; (append-to-init-file (prin1-to-string sexp)))
      (if (equal (symbol-name (car sexp)) "with-key-map")
          (emit-keymap (cdr sexp))
        (append-to-init-file (prin1-to-string sexp))))
#+end_src

It will unroll loops defined in /with-hook/ macro, but it seems to me that
version with unrolled loops is actually slower than one with the loop. I am not
sure but I think that my init file is too small so extra parsing probably adds
more overhead than the loop itself.

** Init files generation

*BACKUP YOUR INIT FILE(S) BEFORE YOU USE THIS TOOL*

/genereate-init-files/ - generates early-init.el and init.el from the provided
                       configuration.

** Init file installation

/install-init-files/   - install init.el and early-init.el into .emacs.d. Init.el
                       will also be byte compiled. If native compiler is present it 
                       will be natively compiled too.

Care has to be taken when starting from scratch, to remove ~/.emacs as it is
created by Emacs on a very first startup.

*** Tips
If you put generator.org in your .emacs.d directory, you don't need to run
/install-init-files/ command, since the tool generates init files in same directory
where the tool is. 

While experimenting and writing a configuration, it is possilbe to make a misstake
and end-up with a non-working init file. For this reason I always test the configuration
by running another instance of Emacs, with M-& emacs or from the command line. If Emacs
starts without problems I will then (maybe) restart my Emacs.

If you still end-up with an error in your init file, and don't have a running Emacs process,
then either run Emacs with --debug-init or -Q option and open the tool, edit the misstake
and generate new init file(s).

Bind a shortcut to open your init file, or at least make a bookmark. It is really handy to
just press a key and have your configuration open when you hack on your Emacs. If you check
[[https://github.com/amno1/.emacs.d][my personal configuration]] you can see I am using /C-f i/,
to open the init file. My init file is placed in my .emacs.d directory and renamed to init.org

You can bind your init file to a key with following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-f i" (lambda() (interactive) (find-file (expand-file-name "init.org" user-emacs-directory)))))
#+end_src

C-f is a prefix I have defined in my own Emacs, you can use some other combination or define
C-f as a prefix.

** Disabling a package

It is sometimes useful to keep a configuration of a package despite not using it.
Packages marked with /:disable/ tag on it's subheading are simply skipped. Observe
also, since this is a generator; every change to the configuration require files to
be re-generated. This is not a dynamic solution like use-package.

** Package installation

/install-packages/ - downloads packages not tagged as :pseudo from the list.

Pseudo tag is needed for configuring built-in stuff like 'Emacs' or 'Dired' so
we can configure them as if they were packages. 

Currently I haven't implemented things like updateing, pinning to an archive or
uninstalling. For updates I am using auto-package-update, and I never uninstall
packages anyway. It wouldn't be hard to implement those things, but I don't
think I have time nor a need for the moment; maybe in some distant future.

One of the goals I had, was to be able to bootstrap all external packages once I
download my configuration from the git repository. Again for the simplicity, I
thought it would be nice if everything is self-contained. As org-mode is good at
structuring, why not use the configuration itself as a list of packages to
install? It adds some noise in turn by having some empty code blocks, but they
are colapsed and thus not really in the way. Having every package listed also
gives a nice overview of what packages are used. Since all code is in some
macro, either in eval-after-load or in a hook, it means configuration for each
package is well-structured and independent of each other so I can actually sort
the list for even more order which makes it really easy to jump to things with
helm-imenu for example. I had to write a small parser for the org file, but in
Emacs it is almost a trivial thing to do. Take a look at /get-package-list/ if you
are interested.

* Included Files

Generator.org is an almost empty configuration containing just few packages,
while example-setup.org is what I use personally and is more worked out example
that shows how to use both early-init and packages sections (in case you are new
to Emacs). Either just rename generator.org to something you will work with, and
start by adding to it or use [[https://github.com/amno1/.emacs.d/blob/main/init.org][init.org]] from [[https://github.com/amno1/.emacs.d][my own setup]] and remove what you don't
like and add your stuff in. My setup is brutally minimal when it comes to graphical
components, so if you wish to turn them on, remove respective line in early init
section.

* Contributing

If you find bugs, please either send a PR or a patch in email, or open an
issue. I don't promise I will fix it fast; we are currently waiting a baby so
hacking is not my priority at the moment; but if I can, I'll try to fix it as
fast as I can.
